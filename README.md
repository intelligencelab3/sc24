# GROOT: Graph Edge Re-growth and Partitioning for the Verification of Large Designs in Logic Synthesis

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python packages: `torch` and `torch_geometric`
- Readline package (follow ABC installation requirements):
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev`
  - CentOS/RedHat: `sudo yum install readline-devel`

### Compile ABC Customized for Graph Learning

Implementation
Data Generation
Data generation scripts are in dataset_prep/dataset_generator.py. The class ABCGenDataset offers different generation types (gentype):

0: CSA-array Multiplier generation and labeling
1: CPA Adder generation and labeling
2: Read a design and generate a dataset
3: Generate Booth-encoded multiplier (in development)
